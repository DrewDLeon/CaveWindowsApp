Using panels, we managed to have a UI good to work with as an User, since you can click an display the "Information" from us by clicking a single button, also, you have the 3 apps, keeping the design simple, but comfortable.

## Cave Music

Using Childforms, classes, and a lot of work into having conectivity between the Childforms and the Music Player, we managed to have this Music Player good, having a nice UI, keeping the same colors that we think "Cave" is, and also this is an app that still can have some changes.

## Cave Learn

Using buttons, we wanted to create an app with a lot of information, so you could have some information based on the Entertainment Industry, also, we have some fun facts about the information displayed.

## Cave Movies

Using Windos Media Player, one of the apps that makes me feel more proud, because it feels right in the way I wanted it to feel when I developed it, this app is a Media Player when you can import any video from your computer, set a Queue and play any video from the Queue, you can navegate between the videos, and also, if I could have more time to work on it, probably I would add many more features to it.
